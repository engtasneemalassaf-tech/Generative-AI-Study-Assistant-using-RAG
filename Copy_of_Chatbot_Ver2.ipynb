        "The RAG-based study assistant performed effectively in retrieving relevant course content and generating grounded, context-aware answers, with prompt engineering playing a key role in improving explanation quality and handling indirect or rephrased questions. One limitation encountered was the selection of local open-source language models: *flan-t5-small* produced fast but often imprecise responses, while *mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2* delivered stronger reasoning at the cost of very slow inference. After experimentation, *flan-t5-base* provided the best balance between accuracy and response time for local execution. The use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation significantly improved answer reliability by grounding responses in the course materials rather than relying on the model’s parametric knowledge, which reduced hallucinations and increased the relevance and consistency of the generated answers.\n"
